6) Problem Description
Postfix expressions are an ordering of mathematical operations, where the operator(+,-,* etc) comes after the operands.

For instance, an operation 2 + 3 (infix notation, which humans use) will be represented as 2 3 + in postfix notation. The computers can understand postfix notation.

Your job is to evaluate the given postfix expression. The expression is given as a string where each token is separated by a space.

The possible operators can be +, - and *

Note that all operands(numbers) are assumed to be non-negative.

Input format
One line of input, containing the string S.

Output format
Print the result of the given expression

Sample Input 1
2 3 +

Sample Output 1
5

Explanation 1
3 + 2 = 5

Sample Input 2
2 3 1 * + 9 -

Sample Output 2
-4

Explanation 2
If the expression is converted into an infix expression, it will be 2 + (3 * 1) â 9 = 5 â 9 = -4.

Constraints
1 <= |S| <= 100

S[i] >= 0, where S[i] is an operand in the expression
